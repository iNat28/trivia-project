Trivia Game by Netanel Feinberg and Yonatan Poch

## Description

Welcome to our Trivia Game! Here you can compete against other local players to see who is truly the best at trivia

- Players need to sign in or sign up for their own personal trivia account in order to play with others and see their own stats from previous games
- Once logged in, players can host their own trivia room and compete against their friends in a challenging trivia match
- Alternatively, they could join someone else's trivia room and play against them and other friends
- Gameplay for each trivia match
    * Throughout each game, players will all be given the same series of questions
    * Each question will have multiple choice answers that the players will select by what they think is the correct answer
    * There is a set number of seconds to answer each question, and when the time's up for that question, the correct answer will be revealed
    * If a player answered the question correctly, they will be given a set amount of points determined by how fast they answered the question
    * Then, they will move on to the next question and repeat this until they have answered all the questions set for that room
    * When the game's finished, all players will see the scoreboard for that game which will show how many points each player got for that game
    * The player with the most amount of points wins the game!
- Each game can be configured in the room's settings to determine the number of questions the players will have to answer and how many seconds they will have to answer each question
- Players can check their stats from previous games to see their total number of points and games, how many correct and incorrect answers they have selected from previous games, and their average answer time
- Players can also check the high scores for all players
